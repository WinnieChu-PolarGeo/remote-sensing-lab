# Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing of Snow: Comparative Analysis of Observation Methods


### Introduction: :memo: 

This laboratory exercise is designed to help undergraduate students in glaciology to understand the differences between various sources of thermal infrared (TIR) observations of snow. Students will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each method and consider the types of research questions that can be addressed with these observations.
