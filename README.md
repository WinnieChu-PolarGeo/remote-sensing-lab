# Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing of Snow: Comparative Analysis of Observation Methods 
## Lab for EAS-4803 Glacier & Ice Sheet Dyanmics 


### Introduction: :memo: 

This laboratory exercise is designed to help undergraduate students in glaciology to understand the differences between various sources of thermal infrared (TIR) observations of snow. Students will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each method and consider the types of research questions that can be addressed with these observations. 

### Lab Description: :dart: 

In this lab, students will work with three different sources of TIR data collected during the SnowEx 2020 campaign:  
1. Ground-based radiometer measurements from snow pits 
2. Airborne thermal infrared imagery
3. ASTER satellite TIR data 

Students will analyze and compare these datasets to understand their spatial and temporal resolutions, accuracy, and potential applications in snow science.
